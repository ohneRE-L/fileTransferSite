## ‚ú® Overview

`fileTransferSite` is a **lightweight and secure** web application built with Spring Boot, designed for simple and ephemeral file sharing. It allows users to effortlessly upload files and receive a unique, shareable download link. With features like optional expiration times and automatic cleanup, it's perfect for quickly sharing files that don't need to persist indefinitely. The application focuses on a streamlined user experience, providing direct links and QR codes for convenience.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **üì§ Easy File Uploads**: Upload any file through a simple web interface.
*   **üîó Unique Download Links**: Generates a unique UUID-based link for each uploaded file, ensuring privacy and direct access.
*   **‚è≥ Configurable Expiration**: Set an optional expiration time (in minutes) for files, after which they are automatically deleted.
*   **üßπ Automated Cleanup**: A background task periodically cleans up all expired files, maintaining data hygiene.
*   **üì± QR Code Generation**: Upon upload, a QR code is generated for the download link, making it easy to share across devices.
*   **üíæ In-Memory Storage**: Utilizes an H2 in-memory database for quick setup and ephemeral storage, ideal for development or temporary sharing.
*   **üìè Customizable File Size**: Default max file size of 10MB, easily configurable via `application.properties`.

## üíª Getting Started

Follow these steps to get `fileTransferSite` up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following essential software installed on your system:

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: `Version 17` or higher
    *   [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (or use OpenJDK)
*   **Apache Maven**: `Version 3.x` or higher (usually bundled with IDEs or available via package managers)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ohneRE-L/fileTransferSite.git
    cd fileTransferSite
    ```

2.  **Build the project using Maven**:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    # On Windows: .\mvnw.cmd clean install
    ```
    This command will download dependencies and compile the project.

3.  **üìù Configure Environment Variables (Optional)**:
    While `fileTransferSite` uses an in-memory H2 database by default (so no external setup is strictly needed), you can configure aspects like file size limits in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

    ```properties
    # src/main/resources/application.properties
    spring.application.name=fileTransferSite
    spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=10MB # Adjust as needed
    spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=10MB # Adjust as needed
    # ... other H2 database settings already present
    ```

### Running the Application

To launch `fileTransferSite`:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# On Windows: .\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

Once started, the application will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
Open your browser and navigate to this address to start uploading files!
